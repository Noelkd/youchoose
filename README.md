A [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) web server for the creation of temporary youtube playlists using websockets. 

Currently to run, clone the repo and cd in to the `src` directory then:

    python serv.py
    
This will create a new service running on port 8888, point your browser at `http://localhost:8888` and you will be greated by the index page. Start a new session by clicking the button, then you can add new songs to the playlist by pasting the YouTube URL into the input box and pressing enter or the submit button.
